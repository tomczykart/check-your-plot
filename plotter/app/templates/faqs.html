      <h4 class="display-9">Where do i get this plot id number?</h4>
      <p class="py-4">
        In Polish language it is called "Numer identyfikacyjny dzia≈Çki ewidencyjnej". If you have any documents about your plot, it should be there somewhere.
        Otherwise, you can always go for geoportal <a href="https://www.geoportal.gov.pl/">https://www.geoportal.gov.pl/</a> and into "Geoportal Krajowy". Track your plot manually,
        and click on it. And now, if you click on the first tab in the popup window, you will get the number.
      </p>
      <h4 class="display-9">Why should I use this side if everything is in the geoportal?</h4>
      <p class="py-4">
         Most of the information you can find on this page is in geoportal. However, you can get that information way quicker here, and
         the crucial difference is the area of the plot. Geoportal has hidden that information since 24.08.2020.
      </p>
      <h4 class="display-9">I need more info. Where can I find it?</h4>
      <p class="py-4">
        I suggest you start looking for local map services of the city office. Not all of the information is aviable to the government global database.
